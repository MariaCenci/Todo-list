# TO DO LIST

This is a to do list built using React.js and Tailwind.

In this APP you can:
- Add a to do
- Delete a to do
- Change its state to complete/incomplete
- Search a to do
- Filter by category
- Filter by completed/incomplete
- Filter by ascending/descending order

It was a very good way to better understand CRUD and react state changes.
